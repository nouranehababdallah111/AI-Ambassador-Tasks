A cinematic, photorealistic photograph inside a dimly lit museum gallery. 
The iconic Bust of Nefertiti rests inside a large glass display case. 
Magical, glowing golden elements illuminate the scene: on the back glass, 
a glowing outline map of Egypt containing the shining Arabic text "رصم". 
A radiant path made of golden light and ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs extends 
from the base of the bust, past a golden Horus falcon statue with spread wings, 
and leads out through a large window towards a realistic view of the Giza Pyramids 
and the Nile river at dramatic sunset. The lighting is warm and dramatic, 
contrasting with the dark museum interior. 8k resolution, highly detailed.
